I am Troels Elsvad Lund, a software engineer based in Frederiksberg, Denmark. I hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science and engineering from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). I have three years of experience in the software industry and have primarily worked as a full-stack developer.

My fascination with IT began early in life — at the age of 11, I started developing websites, and over the years, this passion for technology and software grew stronger, ultimately leading me to pursue it as a career.

Professionally, I really enjoy working with technologies like C#/.NET, React.js, Next.js, Java, TypeScript, T-SQL, and Git. I’m focused on building real, useful solutions and always try to keep the user’s needs in mind. I also have a solid understanding of agile ways of working and like seeing projects move forward in a practical, hands-on way.

Beyond coding, I thrive on sports activities, having proudly represented the national sprint kayaking team for six years. I also relish spending time outdoors, staying active through training, and creating cherished moments with my wife and daughter.
